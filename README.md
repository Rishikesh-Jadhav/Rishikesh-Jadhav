# Rishikesh Jadhav
Simulation Engineer (Computer Vision, 3D, Robotics) at Duality AI — I build simulation-first perception systems and productize research with reproducible, production-grade tooling.

## Focus
- Visual learning and recognition, multi-view/3D vision, and robotics simulation
- Research-to-production: reproducibility, CI, datasets at scale, and reliable evaluation
- Cloud ML (GCP), containers, and tooling that makes experiments repeatable

## Currently
- Preparing for Google Cloud's Professional ML Engineer certification by building ML projects on GCP

## Featured projects
- Birds-Eye-View Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving — Multi-camera BEV forecasting using PowerBEV, with reproducible training/eval and results tables  
  `https://github.com/Rishikesh-Jadhav/Birds-Eye-View-Trajectory-Prediction-for-Autonomous-Driving`
- ARIAC 2023: Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation — ROS-based competition stack with simulation and task orchestration  
  `https://github.com/Rishikesh-Jadhav/ARIAC-AgileRoboticsforIndustrialAutomationCompetition2023`
- 3D Indoor Mapping and Object Segmentation — Navigation-oriented mapping and segmentation in complex environments  
  `https://github.com/Rishikesh-Jadhav/3D-Indoor-Mapping-and-Object-Segmentation`
- CMSC848F — 3D Vision coursework, project implementations, and reviews  
  `https://github.com/Rishikesh-Jadhav/CMSC848F-3D-Vision`

## Skills
Python, C++, PyTorch, OpenCV, ROS, CUDA, Linux, Git, Docker, Google Cloud, MATLAB, Pandas

## How I work
- Reproducible environments and seeds; clear setup and run instructions
- CI for linting, type checks, and tests; coverage where meaningful
- Architecture diagrams, results tables with baselines, and demo media
- Licenses, changelogs, and small, shippable releases
